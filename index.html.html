		<h3>Roll the dice</h3>
		<p>if you’re going to try, go all the<br>
		way.<br>
		otherwise, don’t even start.<br></p>

		<p>if you’re going to try, go all the<br>
		way.
		this could mean losing girlfriends,<br>
		wives, relatives, jobs and<br>
		maybe your mind.<br></p>

		<p>go all the way.<br>
		it could mean not eating for 3 or 4 days.<br>
		it could mean freezing on a<br>
		park bench.<br>
		it could mean jail,<br>
		it could mean derision,<br>
		mockery,<br>
		isolation.
		isolation is the gift,<br>
		all the others are a test of your<br>
		endurance, of<br>
		how much you really want to<br>
		do it.<br>
		and you’ll do it<br>
		despite rejection and the worst odds<br>
		and it will be better than<br>
		anything else<br>
		you can imagine.<br></p>

		<p>if you’re going to try,<br>
		go all the way.<br>
		there is no other feeling like<br>
		that.<br>
		you will be alone with the gods<br>
		and the nights will flame with<br>
		fire.<br>
		do it, do it, do it.<br>
		do it.<br></p>

		<p>all the way<br>
		all the way.<br></p>

		<p>you will ride life straight to<br>
		perfect laughter, its<br>
		the only good fight<br>
		there is.<br></p>
